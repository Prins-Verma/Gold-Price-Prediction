# Gold-Price-Prediction
Designed a system that will predict the price of Gold based on its past price and influencing factors like: Stock market, Petroleum price, Rupee-Dollar Exchange, inflation, and interest rate. 
Monthly price data for the period of time- January 2000 to December 2020 was used for the study.
The data is divided into two periods, period Ist from January 2000 to October 2011 during which the gold price exhibits a raising trend and period IInd from November 2011 to 
December 2020 where the gold price is showing a horizontal trend.
There are 3 machine learning algorithms- linear regression, random forest regression and gradient boosting regression is used for analyzing these data.
It has been found that the correlation between the variables is robust during the period Ist and weak during period IInd. While these models show good fit with data during period Ist, the fitness isn't good during the 
period IInd. While random forest regression is found to have better prediction accuracy for the whole period, gradient boosting regression is found to offer better accuracy 
for the 2 periods taken separately.
